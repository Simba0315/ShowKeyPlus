Looking for your Windows product key but unsure where to find it? Let's simplify the process with ShowKeyPlus.

Firstly, it's important to note that the method of finding your product key can vary depending on how you obtained your Windows version:

Purchased from an Authorized Retailer or OEM System Builder:

If you bought Windows from an authorized seller, your product key will typically appear as the Installed key. This also applies to OEM System Builder keys.
Upgraded Windows:

In case you upgraded your Windows, the Original key will be the one that was installed before the upgrade. It's worth mentioning that if you upgraded to Windows 10 for free, you won't receive a traditional product key. Instead, you'll be granted a unique Digital License. The key displayed in such cases will be a generic key specific to the edition.
Bought a New PC with Windows Pre-installed:

For those who purchased a new PC with Windows pre-installed, the product key will already be embedded within your system. In the case of Windows 8 or 10, it will be stored in the firmware. If it's a previous Windows version, it will be stored as an OEM marker. ShowKeyPlus will display the OEM key or indicate if your PC was tailored for Windows Vista or Windows 7.
Edition Compatibility:

Alongside the key, ShowKeyPlus conveniently displays the associated Edition of each key. This helps ensure you have the correct information for your system.
Dark Mode Compatibility:

Additionally, ShowKeyPlus offers dark mode compatibility for users who prefer a darker interface.
With ShowKeyPlus, locating your Windows product key becomes a hassle-free task, allowing you to focus more on personal branding and professional development without worrying about technicalities.
